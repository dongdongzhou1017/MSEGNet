# MSEGNet


Code for the model in the paper MSEGNet: A Hybrid Multi-Scale CNN with Temporal-Contextual Modeling for Enhanced Sleep Staging Using Single-Channel EEG by Dongdong Zhou, Qi Xu, Lauri Kettunen, Qiang Zhang, Fengyu Cong.

This work is under review in [IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement](https://ieee-ims.org/publication/ieee-tim).

The structure of MSEGNet is shown as:

Fig.1 The architecture of our proposed MSEGNet model.  consists of two main components: the feature extraction module (FEM) and the long-term dependency learning module (LDLM).

## Environment ##

- CUDA toolkit 12.6 and CuDNN v8.1.0
- Python 3.10.9
- tensorflow-gpu (2.10.0)
- matplotlib (3.7.0)
- scikit-learn (1.5.0)
- scipy (1.10.1)
- numpy (1.23.5)
- pandas (1.5.3)

- h5py (3.7.0)



## Evaluation datasets ##
We evaluated our MSEGNet with [CCSHS](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/ccshs) and [Sleep-EDF](https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/) datasets.



## Summary ##
Data preparation

1. The format of data and label are .h5 and .csv, respectively. 
2. Construction of Different EEG Input Lengths: 
![contextual input](./images/contextual-input.png)
Fig.2 The construction of inputs involves varying lengths, denoted by Xm, Pm, Sm, C9m, and C15m, corresponding to the conventional 30s input, preceding 60s input, succeeding 60s input, contextual 90s input, and contextual 150s input, respectively. Pm contains Xm-1, Xm, Sm consists of Xm, Xm+1,  C9m comprises Xm-1, Xm and Xm+1,  C15m is comprised of Xm-2, Xm-1, Xm, Xm+1 and Xm+2. The labels for the different input lengths corresponded to the subscript notation, where the labels for $Pm, Sm, C9m, and C15m are denoted as my

Run construction_model_input.m to construct preceding 60s, succeeding 60s, contextual 90s, and contetual 90s input.

Run MSEGNet.py to train the MSEGNet model and save the model weights. 

The mean coufusion matrix of 5-fold cross validation. 

The dimension of the mean confusion matrix is 6*6. The 6th row and column are the sum value.

Run Calculate_reportsvalue.py to get the performance metrics: per-class metrics: precision (PR), recall (RE), F1 score (F1), and overall metrics: mean precision (MPR), mean recall(MRE), mean F1 score (MF1) overall accuracy (ACC), and Cohenâ€™s kappa coefficient (K).
